    <h1>Indirect3D</h1>

    <p>Indirect3D is a completely ridiculous attempt to implement a significant portion of the DirectX / Direct3D API using a HTML canvas's <strong>2d</strong> context. That means doing all the math in JS.</p>

    <p>I started this project at least 10 years ago. It's based on DX9, which came out in 2002â€”but it's not <em>quite</em> that old.</p>

    <p>In 2021, for no especially clear reason, I started working on it again. A rough changelog is below.</p>

    <p>In modern browsers in 2021, it actually runs fairly quickly. As long as it's not trying to do much.</p>

    <p>To start or stop some random animation, hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

    <p>In the scene above, the red and blue triangle have the same vertex model coordinates and same xy translation with offset z depth. You can control that with the red and blue depth controls above.</p>

    <p>Try WASD and QE ðŸ˜‰.</p>

    <p>Finally you can mess with the field of view angle if you want. I don't know what normal cameras are.</p>
    
    <p>The pretty rainbow triangle moves back and forth along the world z-axis, while a colorful little pyramid sits stoically.</p>

    <h2>Changelog</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>August 2021</dt>
      <dd>Convert to TypeScript. Add webpack and TS configs.</dd>
      <dd>Organize into more, smaller files.</dd>
      <dd>Fix bug transposing g and b color channels in triangle list.</dd>
      <dd>Refactor and clean-up LINELIST and LINESTRIP modes to share common functionality.</dd>
      <dd>Implement barycentric coordinate calculation for triangle color blending.</dd>
      <dd>Calculate triangle color blending in CIELAB space rather than sRGB space.</dd>
      <dd>Fix row-major/column-major disconnect and transpose transformation matrices.</dd>
      <dd>Fix triangle z-depth calculation by projecting a ray from the screen back to the plane of the triangle.</dd>
      <dd>Adding that gave me backface culling for free, score!</dd>
      <dd>Fix alpha blending, which was confused about background/foreground.</dd>
      <dd>Added keyboard controls, hahahaha.</dd>
      <dd>Fixed TRIANGLELIST and TRIANGLESTRIP modes and added TRIANGLEFAN.</dd>
      <dd>Switched triangle color calculation from screen space to view space and I think it's a little more stable?</dd>
      <dd>Added lighting.</dd>

      <dt>December 2022</dt>
      <dd>Implement DrawIndexedPrimitive, SetStreamSource, and SetIndices.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Known issues and ToDos</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Line color blending is still done in sRGB space. Will probably look better in CIELAB.</li>
      <li>There's a lot of packing and unpacking RGBA values into Int32 and it's sometimes error prone. Is it necessary? Could <code>Color</code> be a struct (or a few structs for different color spaces)?</li>
      <li>The aliasing, oh god the aliasing!</li>
      <li>So... depth is hard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things that work pretty well</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Barycentric coordinates work great for triangle coloring. (Even if they're in the wrong coordinate system.)</li>
      <li>sRGBâ€”XYZâ€”CIELAB color space conversion, and doing the color blending in CIELAB, looks real nice.</li>
      <li>Alpha blending is now working correctly!</li>
      <li>Backface culling was fairly straightforward.</li>
    </ul>
