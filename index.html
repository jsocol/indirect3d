  <h1>Indirect3D</h1>
  <p><strong>This may well crash your browser!</strong> You probably
    don't want to try to run the animation in an instance where you're
    doing anything important.</p>
  <p>The animation is two triangles, defined as a set of vertexes, each
    with a position and a primary color with 50% alpha. One triangle is
    fixed in space while the other one moves around it.</p>
  <p>Only runs in <strong>Firefox 4</strong> for some reason. Chromium
    doesn't give any errors but doesn't work, either.</p>
  <p>To start, hit <strong>Enter</strong>. To stop, hit
    <strong>Esc</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Coloring algorithm for triangles is just plain wrong.</li>
    <li>Something is not transforming correctly, at all.<ul>
      <li>The moving triangle should rotate in place.</li>
      <li>Also the bottom right corner should really be the top.</li>
      <li>When I order the transforms the way I think I should, things
      get very weird.</li>
      <li>Moving the camera doesn't quite do what you thing it will.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>No triangle culling yet, which leads to...</li>
    <li>...aberrant behavior with triangles of certain orientations.</li>
    <li>It's slow as hell, but I don't think that will change.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Things that work pretty well</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The alpha-blending algorithm seems basically accurate.</li>
    <li>Coloring algorithm for lines is spot on, at least for
      low-distortion projections.</li>
  </ul>
